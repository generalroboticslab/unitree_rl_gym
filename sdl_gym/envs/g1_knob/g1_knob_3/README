Using the g1_29dof_with_hand.urdf, which is the original URDF file.
The base is still the pelvis_link, and use the library - Robotics Tool Lab's Jacobian to compute the arm's Jacobian.
Robotics Tool Lab can specify the base link and the EE. But it needs to transfer the data back and forth between GPU and CPU.
Set the waists' 3 DOFs pos as constantly, but control arm through IK.
Not sure this Jacobian for arm is correct or not.

Guess: The jacobian computed through RTB is relative to the torso_link's local frame, but the Jacobian acquired through Isaac Gym is the world frame.
